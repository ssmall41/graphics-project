# graphs-project
Final project for my graphics course with Chris Wyman. The program uses OpenGL to create a room in which the user can move about. Needed models are included. The project requires:

A C++ compiler
GLUT (including libxmu and libxi development packages)

Known bugs: On some systems, this project creates a segmentation fault on exit. This should not interfere with running the program.
