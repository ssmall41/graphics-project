Use the makefile provided to build the project. The executable is in the folder 'bin'. The data file to load is 'hw4Scene.txt'.

Controls
---------
Arrow keys 	: Move the position of the eye
g 		: Toggle between regular and grayscale reflection for the dragon mirror
< and > 	: Decrease and Increase the reflectiveness of the two mirrors
- and + 	: Decrease and Increase the number of interreflections (not quite working)
q		: Quits
Left Mouse	: Uses OpenGL select to toggle between Phong and Gooch shading models for objects
Right Mouse	: Rotates the light


The following have been attempted for this project:

Homework 4
-----------
1) Drawing a mirror

2) Drawing a second mirror that reflects the first mirror (not quite working properly)

3) Using an image processing technique on a mirror (grayscale)

4) Using Schlick's approximation to give a partial reflectance to the floor

5) Drawing a complex object with silhouette edges

Homework 5
-----------
6) Drawing objects using Gooch shading

7) Implementation of OpenGL Select

8) Drawing a mirror with a complex shape

9) Loading multiple objects to make the room more interesting
